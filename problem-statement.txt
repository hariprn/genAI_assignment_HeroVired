Step Wise Problem Statement: Stock Market Prediction Using Economic Indicators
________________________________________
Step 1: Data Understanding & Cleaning
Q1. What missing values and outliers exist in the dataset, and how do they affect the reliability of stock price prediction?
•	Identify missing/null values across columns like Close, Volume, Oil, Gold, GDP, etc.
•	Handle missing data (mean/mode imputation or forward fill for time series).
•	Detect outliers in numeric columns (e.g., Volume, Close, Oil) using Z score/IQR.
•	Summarize missing values and outliers with tables/plots.

Step 2: Feature Engineering & Correlation Analysis
Q2. Which technical indicators and macroeconomic variables are most correlated with Close (stock price)?
•	Compute correlation between Close and indicators like EMA_10, EMA_50, ROC_10, mom1, etc.
•	Include macroeconomic variables (DTB3, DGS10, DAAA, DBAA, Oil, Gold, Dollar index).
•	Visualize with a heatmap.
•	Summarize top 5 positively and negatively correlated features.

Step 3: Time Series Trend Analysis
Q3. How do stock prices (Close) react to changes in interest rates and commodity prices over time?
•	Perform time series decomposition on Close.
•	Compare trends with DTB3, DGS10 (interest rates), Oil, Gold, Brent.
•	Identify seasonal patterns and residuals.
•	Summarize how interest rate changes align with market movements.

Step 4: Volatility Analysis
Q4. What are the most volatile periods in the DJI dataset, and how can we detect them?
•	Compute rolling standard deviation of Close.
•	Apply Bollinger Bands using EMA_20 and rolling std.
•	Highlight high volatility periods (e.g., financial crises, oil shocks).
•	Summarize volatility impact on trading strategies.

Step 5: Sector & Stock Performance Analysis
Q5. How do individual stocks (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, JPM, XOM, etc.) and sectors contribute to overall DJI fluctuations?
•	Compare average returns and volatility of major stocks.
•	Group by sector (Tech: AAPL, MSFT, AMZN; Finance: JPM, WFC; Energy: XOM, Brent, Oil).
•	Visualize sector contributions with bar charts.
•	Summarize sector dependencies on DJI performance.
________________________________________
Step 6: Global Indices Comparison
Q6. How do international indices (FTSE, GDAXI, HSI, IXIC, SSEC, RUT, NYSE) move in relation to DJI?
•	Compute correlation between DJI (Close) and global indices.
•	Identify which markets show strongest co movement.
•	Summarize global interdependencies.
________________________________________
Step 7: Macroeconomic Impact on Stock Prices
Q7. How do economic indicators (Inflation proxies: DAAA, DBAA; exchange rates: GBP, JPY, CAD, CNY, EUR, AUD, CHF; commodities: Oil, Gold, Copper, Silver) influence DJI movements?
•	Perform correlation analysis between Close and these variables.
•	Build regression models to quantify relationships.
•	Interpret coefficients (e.g., does rising oil price negatively impact DJI?).
•	Suggest investment strategies based on findings.
________________________________________
Step 8: Futures & Commodity Impact
Q8. How do futures contracts (NASDAQ-F, S&P-F, FTSE-F, gold-F, oil-F, wheat-F) predict or align with DJI movements?
•	Compare DJI with futures data.
•	Identify leading indicators among futures contracts.
•	Summarize predictive power of futures markets.
________________________________________
Step 9: Currency & Dollar Index Analysis
Q9. How do exchange rates (GBP, JPY, CAD, CNY, EUR, AUD, CHF, NZD) and Dollar index affect DJI performance?
•	Correlation/regression analysis between DJI and currency values.
•	Summarize how dollar strength/weakness impacts stock prices.
________________________________________
Step 10: Final Deliverables
Students should provide:
•	Cleaned dataset summary.
•	Correlation heatmaps (technical indicators, macroeconomic variables, global indices).
•	Time series decomposition plots.
•	Volatility charts with Bollinger Bands.
•	Sector & stock performance comparisons.
•	Regression analysis results for macroeconomic impacts.
•	Short report answering Q1–Q9 with insights and visualizations.
